Introduction
============

EXT:cart_products needs to be used together with :t3ext:`cart`.

EXT:cart itself is only the base for a webshop.

Only using EXT:cart does not allow to sell anything because there are no products.

Therefore EXT:cart needs other extensions. One of those other extensions is EXT:cart_events.


**Features:**

* It provides events and their event dates which can be created in the TYPO3 backend.
* The data for those events are stored in own data tables.
* The data fields of the events fit many use cases for seminars, workshops, theatre
  performances or generally date-related seat reservations.
* The events and their dates can be displayed on the website with a list view and a
  detail view.
* It is possible to limit the number of bookable seats per event date or per price
  category of an event date.
* As it extends EXT:cart are the products compatible with EXT:cart and can
  therefore be be purchased with the cart functionality of EXT:cart.
